  CVE-2020-12415:
    title: AppCache manifest poisoning due to url encoded character processing
    impact: high
    reporter: Kevin Higgs
    description: |
      When <code>%2F</code> was present in a manifest URL, Firefox's AppCache behavior may have become confused and allowed a manifest to be served from a subdirectory. This could cause the appcache to be used to service requests for the top level directory.

  CVE-2020-12416:
    title: Use-after-free in WebRTC VideoBroadcaster
    impact: high
    reporter: Alex Mayorga
    description: |
      A <code>VideoStreamEncoder</code> may have been freed in a race condition with <code>VideoBroadcaster::AddOrUpdateSink</code>, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2020-12417:
    title: Memory corruption due to missing sign-extension for ValueTags on ARM64
    impact: high
    reporter: Deian Stefan
    description: |
      Due to confusion about ValueTags on JavaScript Objects, an object may pass through the type barrier, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.<br>*Note: this issue only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.*

  CVE-2020-12418:
    title: Information disclosure due to manipulated URL object
    impact: high
    reporter: Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos
    description: |
      Manipulating individual parts of a  URL object could have caused an out-of-bounds read, leaking process memory to malicious JavaScript.

  CVE-2020-12419:
    title: Use-after-free in nsGlobalWindowInner
    impact: high
    reporter: worcester12345
    description: |
      When processing callbacks that occurred during window flushing in the parent process, the associated window may die; causing a use-after-free condition. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2020-12420:
    title: Use-After-Free when trying to connect to a STUN server
    impact: high
    reporter: Byron Campen
    description: |
      When trying to connect to a STUN server, a race condition could have caused a use-after-free of a pointer, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2020-12402:
    title: RSA Key Generation vulnerable to side-channel attack
    impact: moderate
    reporter: "Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida García, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland"
    description: |
      During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes. <br />We would like to thank Sohaib ul Hassan for contributing a fix for this issue as well.<br />*Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top of it might.

  CVE-2020-12421:
    title: Add-On updates did not respect the same certificate trust rules as software updates
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Chuck Harmston, Robert Hardy
    description: |
      When performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.) This could have caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently without notification to the user.

  CVE-2020-12422:
    title: 'Integer overflow in nsJPEGEncoder::emptyOutputBuffer'
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ronald Crane
    description: |
      In non-standard configurations, a JPEG image created by JavaScript could have caused an internal variable to overflow, resulting in an out of bounds write, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2020-12423:
    title: DLL Hijacking due to searching %PATH% for a library
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Riccardo Ancarani
    description: |
      When the Windows DLL "webauthn.dll" was missing from the Operating System, and a malicious one was placed in a folder in the user's %PATH%, Firefox may have loaded the DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution. <br>*Note: This issue only affects the Windows operating system; other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2020-12424:
    title: WebRTC permission prompt could have been bypassed by a compromised content process
    impact: low
    reporter: Paul Theriault
    description: |
      When constructing a permission prompt for WebRTC, a URI was supplied from the content process. This URI was untrusted, and could have been the URI of an origin that was previously granted permission; bypassing the prompt.

  CVE-2020-12425:
    title: Out of bound read in Date.parse()
    impact: low
    reporter: Bruno Keith
    description: |
      Due to confusion processing a hyphen character in Date.parse(), a one-byte out of bounds read could have occurred, leading to potential information disclosure.

  CVE-2020-12426:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 78
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Benjamin Bouvier, Calixte Denizet, Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 77. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
